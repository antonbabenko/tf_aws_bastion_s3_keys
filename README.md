# tf_aws_bastion_s3_keys

A Terraform module for creating a resilient bastion host using auto-scaling group (min=max=desired=1) and populate its
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` with public keys fetched from S3 bucket. Access is via a classic elastic load balancer, which makes it possible to create a Route53 Alias record pointing to the ELB.

This module can append public keys, setup cron to update them and run additional commands at the end of setup. Note that if it is set up to update the keys, removing a key from the bucket will also remove it from the bastion host.

Only SSH access is allowed to the bastion host.

## Input variables:

  * `name` - Name (default, `bastion`)
  * `instance_type` - Instance type (default, `t2.micro`)
  * `ami` - AMI ID of Ubuntu (see `samples/ami.tf`)
  * `region` - Region (default, `eu-west-1`)
  * `iam_instance_profile` - IAM instance profile which is allowed to access S3 bucket (see `samples/iam_s3_readonly.tf`)
  * `enable_monitoring` - Whether to enable detailed monitoring (default, `true`)
  * `s3_bucket_name` - S3 bucket name which contains public keys (see `samples/s3_ssh_public_keys.tf`)
  * `s3_bucket_uri `â€“ S3 URI which contains the public keys. If specified, `s3_bucket_name` will be ignored
  * `vpc_id` - VPC where bastion host should be created
  * `subnet_ids` - List of subnet IDs where auto-scaling should create instances
  * `keys_update_frequency` - How often to update keys. A cron timespec or an empty string to turn off (default)
  * `additional_user_data_script` - Additional user-data script to run at the end
  * `associate_public_ip_address` - Whether to auto-assign public IP to the instance (by default - `false`)
  * `eip` - EIP to put into EC2 tag (can be used with scripts like https://github.com/skymill/aws-ec2-assign-elastic-ip, default - empty value)
  * `key_name` - Launch configuration key name to be applied to created instance(s).
  * `allowed_cidr` - A list of CIDR Networks to allow ssh access to. Defaults to "0.0.0.0/0"
  * `allowed_ipv6_cidr` - A list of IPv6 CIDR Networks to allow ssh access to. Defaults to "::/0"
  * `allowed_security_groups` - A list of Security Group ID's to allow access to the bastion host (useful if bastion is deployed internally) Defaults to empty list
  * `ssh_port` - inbound ssh port (default, `22`)

## Outputs:

  * ssh_user - SSH user to login to bastion
  * security_group_id - ID of the security group the bastion host is launched in.
  * dns_name - DNS name of the ELB.
  * zone_id - canonical hosted zone ID of the ELB (to be used in a Route 53 Alias record).

## Example:

Basic example - In your terraform code add something like this:

    module "bastion" {
      source                      = "github.com/terraform-community-modules/tf_aws_bastion_s3_keys"
      instance_type               = "t2.micro"
      ami                         = "ami-123456"
      region                      = "eu-west-1"
      iam_instance_profile        = "s3_readonly"
      s3_bucket_name              = "public-keys-demo-bucket"
      vpc_id                      = "vpc-123456"
      subnet_ids                  = ["subnet-123456", "subnet-6789123", "subnet-321321"]
      keys_update_frequency       = "5,20,35,50 * * * *"
      additional_user_data_script = "date"
    }

By default, an external IP is allocated to the ELB instance.

If you want to create a Route53 Alias record pointing to the public DNS name of the ELB, you should use code something like this:

    module "bastion" {
      // as above
    }

    data "aws_route53_zone" "zone" {
      name = "example.com"
    }

    resource "aws_route53_record" "alias" {
      zone_id = "${data.aws_route53_zone.zone.zone_id}"
      name    = "bastion.example.com"
      type    = "A"

      alias {
        name                   = "${module.bastion.dns_name}"
        zone_id                = "${module.bastion.zone_id}"
        evaluate_target_health = "false"
      }
    }

After you run `terraform apply` you should be able to login to your bastion host like:

    $ ssh ubuntu@bastion.example.com

PS: In some cases you may consider adding flag `-A` to ssh command to enable forwarding of the authentication agent connection.
